This project, titled `AssignmentProgram`, was developed for the Advanced Java Programming (COP-2805C) course. It demonstrates various key Java programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, exception handling, and GUI development using Swing.

The program features a `Rectangle` class to calculate the area of a rectangle, showcasing encapsulation with getter and setter methods. It also includes a `Vehicle` superclass and a `Car` subclass to illustrate inheritance and polymorphism, including method overriding. Exception handling is an integral part of the project, demonstrating the use of `try-catch-finally` blocks for handling errors like `ArithmeticException` as well as custom exceptions, such as an `InvalidInputException` for validating user input. 

Additionally, the program incorporates graphical user interface (GUI) development using Java Swing. It features interactive components like buttons, text fields, and labels, enabling user-friendly interactions. Event handling is implemented using `ActionListener` and `KeyListener` interfaces to respond to user actions.

Inputs to the program include rectangle dimensions (length and width), vehicle details (brand, year, and number of doors), and a car year entered by the user through the GUI. Outputs consist of the calculated area of the rectangle, engine start messages demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism, and GUI feedback through pop-up messages and dynamic labels.

This assignment integrates important programming concepts and tools, such as object-oriented programming, error handling, custom exceptions, GUI development, and event handling, to create a comprehensive Java application that is both functional and interactive.
